    <h1 id="header">Our Work</h1>
    <div id="text"> 
        <p>In Our Home page, We classified all group members under the class name "members-col", We then styled it by sizing its box, padding it and then circling its borders</p>
         <p>After that we then styled the paragraph element making sure its texts are always white with a defined font size and font weight padded by 10 pixels<br>Member Maxwell then classified the "Home About Us" and etc links with a class name of "nav-links" which he then styled with a hover concept known as "over effect" so that a red line expands from the middle of the text you hover above</p>
        <p>In the Contact Us Page, We used class name "headings" in the "div" tag to group all the content in the header( i.e. the Group name and the links) and give them a border and a colour blue but we could'nt use that class name to style all the content cause we had different styles in mind for each one.With the "id" name "Header",on the div tag for the Group name,We increased the group name's font and used the "id" name "links",on the div tag for the links,to change the font styles of the links and pad them from the group name.</p>
        <p>And lastly We created an "id" style for the footer, We made a box by specifying its width and height inside of its border whose colour is still blue and by using the property "position relative" we can move content anywhere around the page(using property left/right..etc).</p>
